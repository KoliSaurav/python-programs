* Python program to perform different Arithmetic Operations

INPUT:-

a1 = int(input("Enter the 1st value:"))
b1 = int(input("Enter the 2nd value:"))

add = a1 + b1
print("Addition of two numbers are:",add)

sub = a1 - b1
print("Subtraction of two numbers are:",sub)

mul = a1 * b1
print("Multiplication of two numbers are:",mul)

div = a1 / b1
print("Division of two numbers are:",div)

mod = a1 % b1
print("Modulus of two numbers are:",mod)

expo = a1 ** b1
print("Exponential of two numbers are:",expo)

OUTPUT:-
Enter the 1st value:15
Enter the 2nd value:5
